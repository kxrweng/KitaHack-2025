You can consider using the STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result) methodology to improve your solution.\n\nSample Answer:\nSituation: In my previous role as a project manager, we were working on a software update for a major client, and a key developer unexpectedly left the team two weeks before the deadline.\n\nTask: I had to ensure the project stayed on track without compromising quality.\n\nAction: I immediately reassessed our timeline and reassigned tasks based on the teamâ€™s strengths. I also communicated with the client to adjust expectations and secured an extra resource from another team to help with critical components. To ensure we met the deadline, I organized daily check-ins to monitor progress and remove roadblocks.\n\nResult: As a result, we successfully delivered the update on time with minimal disruptions. The client appreciated our transparency, and the project even led to an extended contract with them.";
